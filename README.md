# IKFF

This repository was created as part of the Digitization for Preservation and Accessibility course at the University of Borås (2025). It undertakes the digitisation of documents related to the fundraising activities of Swedish Branch of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (Internationella Kvinnoförbundet för Fred och Frihet/ IKFF), particularly in relation to The Great Peace Journey (Den Stora Fredsresan), between 1984-1986. 

It aims to support both the availability and the long-term preservation of these documents.

23 NEF RAW Image files  

23 XML files containing the metadata for each image file

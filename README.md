This repository was created as part of the Digitization for Preservation and Accessibility course at the University of Borås (2025). It documents the digitization of documents related to the fundraising activities of Swedish Branch of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (Internationella Kvinnoförbundet för Fred och Frihet/ IKFF), particularly in relation to The Great Peace Journey (Den Stora Fredsresan) undertaken between 1985-1986.
